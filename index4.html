    <p><br><br>The concept that "the simpler the form of a letter the simpler its reading" was an obsession of beginning constructivism. It became something like a dogma, and is still follow by "modernist" typographers. 

      <br>     <br>  This notion has proved to be wrong, because in reading we do not read letters but words, words as a whole, as a "word picture." This was discovered in psychology, particularly in Gestalt psychology. Ophthalmology has disclosed that the more the letters are differentiated from each other, the easier the reading. 
        
      <br>     <br>   Without going into comparisons and details, it should be realized that words consisting of only capitals letters present the most difficult readingâ€”because of their equal height, equal volume, and , with most, their equal width. When comparing serif letters with sans-serif, the latter provide an uneasy reading. The fashionable preference for sans-serif in text shows neither historical nor practical competence. 
        
      <br>      <br>  First, sans-serif were designed as letters not for texts but for captions, when pictorial reproductions were introduced with stone lithography. Second, they produce poor "word pictures." 
        
      <br>      <br> In musical compositions, so long as we hear merely single tones, we do not hear music. Hearing music depends on the recognition of the in-between of the tones, of their placing and of their spacing. 
         
      <br>      <br> In writing, a knowledge of spelling has nothing to do with an understanding of poetry. 
        
      <br>      <br>  Equally, a factual identification of colors within a given painting has nothing to do with a sensitive seeing nor with an understanding of the color action within the painting.
        
      <br>      <br> Our study of color differs fundamentally from a study which anatomically dissects colors (pigments) and physical qualities (wave length). 
        
      <br>      <br> Our concern is the interaction of color; that is, seeing what happens between colors. We are able to hear a single tone. But we almost never (that is, without special devices see a single color unconnected and unrelated to other colors. Colors present themselves in continuous flux, constantly related to changing neighbors and changing conditions. 
        
      <br>     <br>  As a consequence, this proves for the reading of colors what Kandinsky often demanding for the reading of art: what counts is not the what but the how.
