         <h1>Color Juxtaposition—Harmony</h1></a>  
          <p>
         Color systems usually lead to the conclusion that certain constellations within a system provide color harmony. They indicate that this is mainly the aim and the end of color combination, of color juxtaposition. 

           <br> <br>  As harmony and harmonizing is also a concern of music, so a parallelism of effect between tone combinations and color combinations seems unavoidable and appropriate. Although a comparison of composed colors with composed tones is very challenging, it should be mentioned that, while it can be helpful, it is often misleading. 
            
            
           <br> <br>  This is because different basic conditions of these media result in different behavior. 
            
           <br> <br>  Tones appear placed and directed predominately in time from before to now to later. 
            
           <br> <br>  Their juxtaposition in a musical composition if perceived within a prescribed sentence only. Vertically, so to say, 1 tone, or several simultaneously, sound for a varying but restricted length of time. Horizontally, the tones follow each other, perhaps not in a straight line, but of necessity in a prescribed order and only 1 direction—forward. Tones heard earlier fade, and those farther back, disappear, vanish. We do not hear them backward. 
            
           <br> <br>  Colors appear connected predominantly in space. Therefore, as constellations they can be seen in any direction and at any speed. And as they remain, we can return to them repeatedly and in many ways. This remaining and not remaining, or vanishing and not vanishing shows only 1 essential difference between the fields of tone and color. 
            
           <br> <br>  The accuracy of perception in one field is match by the durability of retention in the other, demonstrating a curious reversal in visual and auditory memory. 
            
           <br> <br>  Tone juxtapositions can be defined by their acoustical relationship and thus measured precisely by wave length. Consequently, a graphic registration of tones in musical composition has been developed. 
            
           <br> <br>  Color, also, can be measured, at least to some extent, and particularly so when it is presented as direct color—as the physicist registers it, by optical wave length. 
            
            <br> <br> Reflected color, however, coming from paint and pigment—our main medium—is much more difficult to define. 
            
          <br> <br>   When analyzed with an electrical spectrograph reflected colors shows that it contains all visible wave lengths. Therefore, any reflected color—not just white—consists of all colors.
