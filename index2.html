 <p>

   <p>If one says "red" and there are 50 people listening, 
    It can be expected that there will be 50 reds in their minds. 
    And one can be sure that all these reds will be very different <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Even when a certain color is specified which all listeners have seen
    Innumerable items—such as the red of the Coca-Cola signs which is the same red all over the country—they will still think of many different reds. <br>
    </p>
  
    And even if that round red Coca-Cola sign with the white name in the middle is actually shown so that everyone focused on the same red, each will receive the same project on his retina, but no one can be sure whether each has the same perception. <br>
    <br>
    When we consider further the associations and reactions which are experienced in connection with the color and the name, probably everyone will diverge again in many different directions. 
    <br><br>
    What does this show? <br>
    <br>
    First, it is hard, if not impossible, to remember distinct colors. 
    This underscores the important fact that the visual memory is very poor in comparison with our auditory memory. Often the latter is able to repeat a melody heard only once or twice. <br>
    <br>
    Second, the nomenclature of color is most inadequate. Though there are innumerable colors—shades and tones—in daily vocabulary, there are only about 30 color names.
