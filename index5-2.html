    If one is not able to distinguish the difference between a higher tone and a lower tone, one should probably not make music. 

         <br> <br>If a parallel conclusion were to be applied to color, almost everyone would prove incompetent for its proper use. Very few are able to distinguish higher and lower intensity (usually called higher and lower value) between different hues. This is true despite our daily reading of numerous black-and-white pictures. 
        
         <br> <br>Since the discovery of photography and particularly since the development of photomechanical reproduction process, we are exposed—more and more every day—to pictures from all over the world, the world seen and unseen, visible and invisible. 
        
         <br> <br>These pictures, which are predominantly "black and white," are printed in only 1 black on a white ground. Visually, however, these pictures consist of grey shades of the finest gradation between the poles of black and white. These shades penetrate each other in varying degrees. 
        
         <br> <br>With the tremendous increase in pictorial information—through newspapers, magazines, books—we receive a training in the reading of lighter and darker tones of grey as has never before existed. With the growing interest in color photography and color reproduction, a parallel training in the reading of lighter and darker colors is on the way. 
        
         <br> <br>However, it is still true that only a minority can distinguish the lighter from the darker within close intervals when obscured by contrasting hues or by different color intensities. 
        
         <br> <br>Color intensity—brightness:
        
         <br> <br>With some training in gradation studies, one can expect to come to an agreement on different light intensities. 
        
         <br><br>However, when it comes to color intensity (brightness), occasionally one may find agreement among a few people but hardly within a large group such as a class. 
        
         <br> <br>Everyone has preference for certain colors and prejudices against others. This applies to color combinations as well. It seems good that we are of different tastes. As it is with people in out daily life, so it is with color. We change, correct, or reverse our opinions about colors, and this change of opinion may shift forth and back.
        
         <br> <br>Therefore, we try to recognize our preferences and our aversions—what colors dominate in our work; what colors, on the other hand, are rejected, disliked, or of no appeal. Usually a special effort in using disliked colors ends with our falling in love with them.
