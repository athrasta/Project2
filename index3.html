    </div>

    <p>To achieve a new sculptural illusion of intersecting colors, note that the separating boundaries of a middle mixture look elevated, or raised from the ground, which causes a "fluting" effect known from the channelings of a Doric column.  </p>

    <p>Our studies of illusionary transparence have shown how difficult it is to find a middle mixture.  </p>
        
    <p>A true middle mixture is distinguished by being equidistant—in light and in hue—from either mixture parent.  </p>
        
    <p>Unfortunately, for an untrained eye, it is hard to recognize such equidistance. </p>

    <p>We have seen that the color boundaries between the mixing color and the mixed one have proved to be helpful measures.  </p>
        
    <p>The purpose of the new problem, intersecting colors, is to show and to produce a certain constellation by which even an untrained eye will recognize within a mixture not only the constituents but also their respective amounts within that mixture.  </p>
        
    <p>For an initial experience in this direction find 3 equally large sheets of 1 red in 3 shades, a light red, the same red darker, and the almost always elusive middle mixture of these reds. Or, if not available in red, take any other color providing a lighter, a middle, and a darker shade or tint.  </p>
        
    <p>Place them adjacent to one another with the lighter red to the left and overlapped by the edge of the middle red; then place the dark red on top of the middle red, allowing only a narrow strip of the middle red (about 1/4 an inch wide) to remain visible.  </p>
